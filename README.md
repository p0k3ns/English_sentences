# English_sentences
A recursive network model that learns to build sentences in English.
The aim of the project is to build and fine-tune a model learning to build correct sentences in English. The collection of books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling was used as the teaching text. The neural network will build sentences based on its estimated probability of a given character on the basis of the characters preceding it in the sequence.
